# hands — web project

Minimal project for a small website. Structure:

- `src/` — site source (HTML/CSS/JS)

Suggested local workflow

- Install any dependencies (if used).
- Build or run dev scripts from `package.json` (for example, `npm run dev:css`).

If you'd like, I can add a remote (GitHub/GitLab) and push the initial commit — send the repo URL and I'll wire it up.
